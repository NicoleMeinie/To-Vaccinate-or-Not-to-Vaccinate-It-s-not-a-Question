# Covid-19 vaccine sentiment analysis 

![Heading](https://images.theconversation.com/files/341551/original/file-20200612-153812-ws3rqu.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip)

Although it may be many months before we see COVID-19 vaccines available on a global scale, it is important to monitor public sentiment towards vaccinations now and especially in the future when COVID-19 vaccines are offered to the public. The anti-vaccination sentiment could pose a serious threat to the global efforts to get COVID-19 under control in the long term.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
